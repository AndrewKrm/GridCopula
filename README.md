## Introduction

In statistical modeling, copulas are essential tools for understanding the dependency structure between random variables. This paper introduces a grid-based framework for copula density estimation using convex optimization and multilinear interpolation. The proposed method enhances both precision and flexibility in modeling complex dependencies across multiple dimensions.

## Notation

- \( g_{i_1,\ldots,i_n} \): Absolute coordinates of grid points in the \( n \)-dimensional space.
- \( Q_{ij} \) or \( Q_{i_1i_2\ldots i_n} \): Relative positions of grid points within a local 2D square or \( n \)-dimensional hypercube, respectively. Here, \( i \) and \( j \) (or \( i_1, i_2, \ldots, i_n \)) take the value of 0 for the lower boundary and 1 for the upper boundary of the hypercube in their respective dimensions. This notation specifies corners of the hypercube surrounding the point of interest.
- \( \alpha_j \): Normalized distance of a point \( P \) in the \( j \)-th dimension from the lower boundary of the enclosing hypercube or square.
- \( [0, 1]^n \): The \( n \)-dimensional unit cube domain.
- \( m \): Number of grid points per axis, leading to a uniform grid.
- \( \frac{1}{m-1} \): Spacing between consecutive points in any dimension.
- \( V(P) \): Estimated value at point \( P \) within the hypercube.

## 2-Dimensional Model

### Bilinear Interpolation Between Grid Points

To estimate the copula density at any point within the 2D unit square, we employ bilinear interpolation based on a uniform grid of \( m \times m \) points.

1. **Identify the Enclosing Square:**

   - For each coordinate \( x_1 \) and \( x_2 \), find \( k \) and \( l \) such that:
     \[
     x_j \in \left[\frac{k_j - 1}{m - 1}, \frac{k_j}{m - 1}\right), \quad j = 1, 2.
     \]
   - The four corners of the enclosing square are:
     \[
     \begin{aligned}
     Q_{00} &= \left(\frac{k - 1}{m - 1}, \frac{l - 1}{m - 1}\right), \\
     Q_{01} &= \left(\frac{k - 1}{m - 1}, \frac{l}{m - 1}\right), \\
     Q_{10} &= \left(\frac{k}{m - 1}, \frac{l - 1}{m - 1}\right), \\
     Q_{11} &= \left(\frac{k}{m - 1}, \frac{l}{m - 1}\right).
     \end{aligned}
     \]

2. **Compute Normalized Distances:**

   - Calculate \( \alpha_1 \) and \( \alpha_2 \) as:
     \[
     \alpha_j = (m - 1) x_j - \left\lfloor (m - 1) x_j \right\rfloor, \quad j = 1, 2.
     \]

3. **Interpolate the Value at \( P \):**

   - The estimated value \( V(P) \) is given by:
     \[
     \begin{aligned}
     V(P) &= V(Q_{00}) (1 - \alpha_1)(1 - \alpha_2) + V(Q_{01}) (1 - \alpha_1) \alpha_2 \\
     &\quad + V(Q_{10}) \alpha_1 (1 - \alpha_2) + V(Q_{11}) \alpha_1 \alpha_2.
     \end{aligned}
     \]

### Ensuring Uniform Marginals

A fundamental property of any copula is that its marginals are uniform over \([0, 1]\). To satisfy this condition in our grid-based model, we impose the following constraints:

1. **Marginal Integration Conditions:**

   \[
   \int_{0}^{1} c(u, v) \, dv = 1, \quad \forall u \in [0, 1],
   \]

   \[
   \int_{0}^{1} c(u, v) \, du = 1, \quad \forall v \in [0, 1].
   \]

2. **Grid-Based Approximation:**

   - We approximate the integrals using discrete sums over the grid:

     \[
     \sum_{j=0}^{m - 2} \frac{V_{i, j} + V_{i, j+1}}{2 \cdot (m - 1)} = 1, \quad \forall i,
     \]

     \[
     \sum_{i=0}^{m - 2} \frac{V_{i, j} + V_{i+1, j}}{2 \cdot (m - 1)} = 1, \quad \forall j.
     \]

3. **Interpretation:**

   - The conditions ensure that the average value along any grid line, multiplied by the grid spacing, sums to 1. This enforces the uniformity of the marginals in the discretized space.

4. **Preservation Under Interpolation:**

   - For any \( \alpha \in [0, 1] \) and functions \( f(x) \) and \( g(x) \) satisfying \( \int_{0}^{1} f(x) \, dx = \int_{0}^{1} g(x) \, dx = 1 \), the linear combination also integrates to 1:

     \[
     \int_{0}^{1} [\alpha f(x) + (1 - \alpha) g(x)] \, dx = \alpha + (1 - \alpha) = 1.
     \]

   - This property confirms that bilinear interpolation preserves the uniform marginals.

## N-Dimensional Model

### Multilinear Interpolation Formula

Extending the 2D model to \( n \) dimensions involves multilinear interpolation within an \( n \)-dimensional hypercube.

1. **Identify the Enclosing Hypercube:**

   - For each coordinate \( x_j \), find \( k_j \) such that:

     \[
     x_j \in \left[\frac{k_j - 1}{m - 1}, \frac{k_j}{m - 1}\right), \quad j = 1, \ldots, n.
     \]

2. **Compute Normalized Distances:**

   - Calculate \( \alpha_j \) for each dimension:

     \[
     \alpha_j = (m - 1) x_j - \left\lfloor (m - 1) x_j \right\rfloor.
     \]

3. **Interpolate the Value at \( P \):**

   - The estimated value \( V(P) \) is:

     \[
     V(P) = \sum_{i_1=0}^{1} \cdots \sum_{i_n=0}^{1} V(Q_{i_1 \ldots i_n}) \prod_{j=1}^{n} \left[ i_j \alpha_j + (1 - i_j)(1 - \alpha_j) \right],
     \]

     where \( Q_{i_1 \ldots i_n} \) are the vertices of the enclosing hypercube.

### Ensuring Uniform Marginals in \( n \) Dimensions

- The uniform marginal conditions extend naturally to higher dimensions.
- The integration over each dimension must satisfy:

  \[
  \int_{0}^{1} c(u_1, \ldots, u_n) \, du_j = 1, \quad \forall j = 1, \ldots, n.
  \]

- Similar to the 2D case, we impose constraints on the grid values to ensure these conditions are met.
